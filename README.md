# Setup

This project requires Python 3.7 which can be installed from the [official Python page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or 
with a package manager such as [anaconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html?highlight=conda#installation).

To install the required libraries, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the project root directory. This will install the 
libraries and you should be good to go. 

Data is located at `data/headlines.txt`. Run `jupyter notebook` to start a Jupyter Notebook and get coding!
